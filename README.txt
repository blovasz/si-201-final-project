Instructions for Running the Code:
1. Create an API key from https://superheroapi.com/, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/, and https://marvelrivalsapi.com/.
2. Insert each API key into the “replace text with key” on each corresponding line in the api_keys.txt file.
3. Run the marvel_rivals.py, comicvine.py, and superhero.py files to create the databases: marvel_rivals.db, comicvine.db, and superhero.db.
4. Run the calculations.py file to perform calculations using data from the databases to create the data calculations files: gender_by_comics.csv, most_played_characters.csv, num_superhero_by_origin.txt, and average_bmi_by_gender.txt.
5. Run the bl-visuals.py and sj-visuals.py files to create the visualizations from calculated data.
